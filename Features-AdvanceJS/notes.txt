Asynchronnous and event-based programming

- A step-by-step guide to help you approach any asynchronous problem effectively and find a good solution:

    ✅ 1. Understand the Problem Clearly
        What exactly needs to happen asynchronously?
        Is it a network request, file I/O, user interaction, or timed operation?
        What are the inputs, expected outputs, and error cases?

    ✅ 2. Identify the Async Nature
        Is it:

        Event-driven (e.g., button click)?
        Promise-based (e.g., fetch, axios)?
        Callback-based (e.g., setTimeout, file read in Node.js)?
        Async/Await-based (modern JS style)?
        Concurrent or Parallel (multiple tasks at once)?

    ✅ 3. Break It into Steps

        Break the problem into small, sequential (or parallel) operations.
        Define what happens before, during, and after the asynchronous action.

    ✅ 4. Use the Right Tool for the Job
        Callbacks – simple but can lead to "callback hell."
        Promises – cleaner for chaining tasks.
        Async/Await – modern, readable, and easier for error handling.
        Choose the right one based on context, readability, and maintainability.

    ✅ 5. Handle Errors Gracefully
        Always use .catch() for Promises or try/catch for async/await.
        Make sure the system can recover or alert the user meaningfully.

    ✅ 6. Visualize or Diagram the Flow
        Use diagrams or write pseudo-code:
        What triggers the async event?
        What should happen when it's done?
        What if it fails?

    ✅ 7. Test with Controlled Inputs
        Start with mock data or fake timers.
        Use tools like setTimeout, mocks, or test APIs to simulate async behavior.

    ✅ 8. Think About Edge Cases
        What if the async operation takes too long?
        What if it returns bad data or times out?
        What if multiple async tasks run at the same time?

    ✅ 9. Keep It Clean and Modular
        Separate logic: keep async code isolated in functions or modules.
        This makes it easier to debug, test, and reuse.

    ✅ 10. Debug and Monitor
        Use tools like:
        console.log/debugger during development.
        Network tab in browser dev tools.
        Postman or cURL to test APIs.

    👩‍💻 Example: fetch with async/await
    
    
    async function loadUser() {
    try {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load user');
        const user = await res.json();
        console.log(user);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err.message);
    }
    }

    🧠 Tip:
    Don't overcomplicate it. If you can avoid async logic for a task, avoid it. But when necessary, 
    plan carefully, break down steps, and isolate complexity.

- All the major async contracts in JavaScript, along with their syntax and how they are used:

        🔹 1. Callback Functions (Old style)
        👉 Syntax:

        function doSomething(callback) {
        // some operation
        callback(result);
        }
        doSomething(function(result) {
        console.log("Result:", result);
        });

        ⚠️ Problems:
         - Callback hell
         - Difficult to manage errors
         - Not chainable

        🔹 2. Promises (Modern standard)
        👉 Syntax:
        
        const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (/* success */) {
            resolve("Success value");
        } else {
            reject("Error message");
        }
        });

        promise
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(error => console.error(error))
        .finally(() => console.log("Done"));


        ✅ Advantages:
           - Chainable
           - Handles errors better than callbacks

        🔹 3. Async/Await (Built on Promises)
        👉 Syntax:
        
        async function fetchData() {
        try {
            const response = await fetch("https://example.com/data");
            const data = await response.json();
            console.log(data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        }
        }
        fetchData();

        ✅ Advantages:
           - Cleaner, synchronous-like code
           - Still uses Promises underneath

        🔹 4. Promise.all()
        Waits for all promises to resolve or rejects if any one fails.

        👉 Syntax:
        
        Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
        .then(values => console.log(values))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));

        🔹 5. Promise.race()
        Returns the first promise that settles (either resolves or rejects).

        👉 Syntax:
        
        Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
        .then(result => console.log("First finished:", result))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));

        🔹 6. Promise.allSettled()
        Waits for all promises, returns array of results (resolved or rejected).

        👉 Syntax:
       
        Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2])
        .then(results => {
            results.forEach(result => {
            if (result.status === "fulfilled") {
                console.log("Success:", result.value);
            } else {
                console.log("Failed:", result.reason);
            }
            });
        });

        🔹 7. Promise.any()
        Returns the first fulfilled promise. Ignores rejections unless all fail.

        👉 Syntax:
        
        Promise.any([promise1, promise2])
        .then(result => console.log("First success:", result))
        .catch(error => console.error("All failed:", error));
        
        ✅ Summary Table
        Feature	Returns	Waits For	Rejects If	Best Use Case
        Promise.all	Array	All	Any fails	All must succeed
        Promise.race	First	First	First fails	Fastest result (success or failure)
        Promise.allSettled	Array	All	Never	Need all outcomes, even if some fail
        Promise.any	First	First pass	All fail	Want just one successful result
