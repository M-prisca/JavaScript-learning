# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning JavaScript — from the basics to more advanced topics. It includes hands-on exercises, notes, and small projects that demonstrate my progress and understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

This repository contains also my solutions to various coding challenges (katas) from [codewars]. Each solution is implemented in JavaScript with clean and efficient code.

## Folder Structure

- `Fundamentals/` – Core concepts: variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, etc.
- `Dom-manipulation/` – Interacting with HTML and the browser using the DOM API.
- `fetch-api/` – Fetching data from external APIs.
- `Local-storage/` – Working with the browser’s localStorage for persistence.
- `Features-AdvanceJS/` – Advanced JavaScript topics and features.
- `async-event-programming/` – Topics on asynchronous JavaScript:
  - `Callbacks/`
  - `Promises/`
  - `Async-await/`
  - `Event-loop/`
  - `events-and-listeners/`
- `Projects/` – Mini JavaScript projects for practice.
- `Notes/` – Notes and summaries from my learning.
- `udacity/` – Assignments and practice from Udacity courses.
- `Exercises/` – Extra exercises and drills to reinforce learning.

## Tools Used

- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
